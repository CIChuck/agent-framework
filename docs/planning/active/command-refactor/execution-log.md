# Shared command refactor — execution log

2026-10-24: The maintainer accepted the separate project scope, requested
activation, and directed all command-refactor planning documents to the
`docs/planning/active/command-refactor/` packet. The dedicated
`feature/command-refactor` branch was initially created from `e591f720`. The packet,
five Markdown source documents and JSON command inventory were relocated;
links and board references are being reconciled as one planning transition.

2026-10-24: The maintainer directed independent branches, command execution
first, and a TUI development hold until the command refactor is completed,
tested, and accepted. The command branch was rebuilt directly from `master`
`c3426986`. Its former stacked tip is retained at
`backup/command-refactor-stacked-20261024`; the TUI branch and its uncommitted
work were not rewritten. See the [branch isolation record](branch-isolation.md).

2026-10-24: Documentation review established a [scope decision register](scope-decisions.md)
and [phase plan](phase-plan.md), clarified the planning chain in the packet
index, marked the older seven-name recommendation as superseded and separated
the six retirement cases from retained-command parity obligations in the JSON
inventory. Technical contract, retired-name response and scored outliers remain
open; this documentation pass does not advance a construction gate.

`execution_phase: planning`; `validation_state: not_ready`.

Next: characterize Chat and `friday-framework-cli`, settle the supported
surface and shared contract, then request exact construction-directive approval.
